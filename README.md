# Mystery Spotify Code Generator
Fun experiment to generate random Spotify codes from scratch, then you 
can scan them in the app to see if they resolve to an artist, song, album, 
playlist, user, etc. They typically don't scan in, and those that do scan
don't typically resolve to anything. But the concept is there!
